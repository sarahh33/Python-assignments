# Problem description
In Finland you have to pay gift tax for gifts that are worth more than 5000 euros. The gift tax must be paid if the total value of gifts exceeds the limit of 5000 euros in the course of three years. So if the same donor gives multiple gifts for the same recipient in the course of three years, the gift tax is determined based on the sum of the values of these gifts. Besides the value of the gifts, the relationship between the donor and the recipient affects the amount of the gift tax.

If the donor and the recipient are close relatives or family, then the gift tax is determined based on the table below

Value of the gift (euros)	Tax at the lower limit (euros)	Tax rate for the exceeding part\
5000-25000	    |  100	  |8%\
25000-55000	    |  1700	  |10%\
55000-200000	  |  4700	  |12%\
200000-1000000	|  22100	|15%\
1000000-	      |  142100	|17%\
If the donor and the recipient are not close relatives, the gift tax is determined based on the table below.

Value of the gift (euros)	Tax at the lower limit (euros)	Tax rate for the exceeding part\
5000-25000	      |  100	  |  19%\
25000-55000	      |  3900 	|  25%\
55000-200000	    |  11400	|  29%\
200000-1000000	  |  53450	|  31%\
