# Problem description
This exercise will model the melting of an ice cube. The ice cube's state or phase can change from solid to liquid or vapour depending on its mass and the amount of energy applied to it. Both heating the ice cube and its phase transitions require energy.

We assume that the ice cube's mass remains the same through the heating process and that all of the energy is used completely, meaning there is no energy loss. Simplify vapours in this exercise so that a vapour's temperature is always 100 Â°C (even though it can actually be higher).
