# Probelm description
Pass the pigs is a game in which a player throws two pigs and their points depend on how the pigs are positioned after the throw. The pigs may be thrown more than once in one turn so that the points gathered in one turn are the sum of points of the individual throws. The turn ends when the player chooses so or if the outcome of a throw is "Pig out", which means that the pigs landed on their sides but with different sides facing upwards. The game is continued until one player has gathered the total of at least 100 points. In this exercise the winning score is 60 points so that testing the execution of the program takes less time.
