# Problem description
It is a rudimentary version of minesweeper, creating the mines based on a file and a "map" of the grid where both the mines and the numbers representing adjacent mines of empty cells are marked. This can be thought of as the map the player will reveal part by part while playing and clicking the cells. In reality the player would never see this map as it is, except for the end of the game when all cells have been revealed. Only a rudimentary version will be created in this exercise because a complete game of minesweeper should definitely be created with object-oriented programming.
